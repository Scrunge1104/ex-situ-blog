					<p>If you're reading this, welcome! This is officially the first post on
					Ex Situ, my little conservation blog project. Born out of a love for wildlife
					(and the know-how to create a website), this blog combines my passion for the 
					natural world with the somewhat nostalgic charm of a completely hand-coded site.</p>
					
					<h2>What does Ex Situ even mean?</h2>
					<p>If you have never heard the term <i>ex situ</i> before, let me explain. As all
					good scientific terms, <i>ex situ</i> comes from Latin, and roughly means 'off site'.
					It is used to describe conservation that is performed outside of the natural habitat
					of the target species. The most well-known type of <i>ex situ</i> conservation is the
					work carried out by zoos and aquariums (or aquaria, if you prefer), though there are 
					several more, including genebanks (such as the <a href="https://sandiegozoowildlifealliance.org/frozen-zoo">San Diego Frozen Zoo</a>), 
					which store sperm and egg cells, plant seeds, et cetera.</p>
					<p>The topics covered on this blog will not be limited to <i>ex situ</i> conservation, 
					of course. I just wanted the blog to have a name that had something to do with the world 
					of wildlife conservation (and pun names with either of the words 'zoo' or 'conservation' are 
					surprisingly hard to come up with).</p>
					
					<h2>What are the goals of Ex Situ?</h2>
					<p>The main goal of this project is to share real scientific knowledge about conservation 
					in a way that makes it easy to understand for a wide audience, including non-scientists, while 
					still maintaining a high level of quality and accuracy (which does mean that some posts will have
					relatively long lists of references). I want people of all backgrounds 
					to be able to find something they like here. Of course, there will very likely be a few 
					posts of 'just for fun' content, but only time will tell where this site goes.</p>
					
					<h2>What will the content of the website look like?</h2>
					<p>As for the content of the posts I make here, I have some particular ideas in mind:</p>
					
					<h3>Zoo Visits</h3>
					<p>I visit zoos and aquariums relatively often. As of writing this post, I currently
					volunteer at ZSL London Zoo, so a considerable amount of my time is spent here. As well 
					as this, a good portion of my life at university was spent evaluating different aspects of 
					different zoos, including enclosure design, signage, and the like. In the near future, you 
					will find a number of posts detailing different visits to zoos around the UK (and potentially 
					beyond). In these posts, amongst the discussion about the animals themselves, I will express my 
					personal opinions on the zoo's enclosures and other facilities based on what I have learned in the 
					past.</p>
					
					<h3>Discussion Posts</h3>
					<p>I would also like to create posts discussing different areas of zoo management, <i>in situ</i> conservation projects (that's 
					the opposite of <i>ex situ</i>, by the way), et cetera. My aim here 
					is to look at things more objectively and scientifically than above, but I will try to make sure I explain 
					all of the complicated jargon that might be used.</p>
					
					<h3>Conservation Rundowns</h3>
					<p>As well as this, I had the idea to create a monthly (or some other time period-ly)
					rundown of conservation news across different areas and organisations. Most organisations
					already have blogs of their own, but this could be my tiny little conservation newsroom, 
					combining new information from multiple sources.</p>
					
					<h3>Species of the Month</h3>
					<p>Finally, each month, I want to shine the spotlight on a specific animal species 
					(especially the ones that often get overlooked). As well as a whole post just about 
					them, the lucky winner will also be featured on the site's homepage, just below the 
					site news. I already have the first species chosen, I just need to write up the post! 
					For future months, I will link a Google form in the SotM (that is, Species of the Month) 
					section so that my lovely visitors (that's you) can nominate an animal they think deserves to 
					be shown some love.</p>
					
					<br>
					<p>I have no doubt that I will come up with more ideas than this, but as I said before, 
					only time will tell where this project takes me.</p>
					<p>With that, I bid you a very warm welcome to Ex Situ. I hope you enjoy your time here!</p>

				<p>Hi! I'm Robbie, a semi-recent graduate of animal science from Anglia Ruskin 
				University and visitor welcome volunteer at ZSL London Zoo. My main goal 
				professionally is to enter the world of zookeeping (don't ask how that's going so 
				far), and this website is my way of keeping my brain occupied with zoo-related topics 
				in the meantime.</p>
				<p>Until about 6 months before starting university, my plan was to study linguistics. 
				I thought it would be better to keep my professional life separate from my hobbies 
				though, and decided to study animals and conservation very last-minute 
				(which surprised basically everybody who knew me).</p>
				<p>As well as my ability to make impulsive decisions that impact the rest of my 
				life, I also have quite a few hobbies and skills (I'm a very indecisive person), 
				including very basic web design. This site was essentially born from two of my 
				most different interests.</p>
				<p>Thank you for visiting, I hope you find something you like here!</p>
